</div><div>Eliminator 2000   
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A longtime ago, when legendary monsters were ruling earth, there was a handsome boy named Jayden and he was getting ready for a little hunt. He lived in a mud burrow, with old bricks supporting it. Fortunately Jayden loved his burrow. His dark brown eyes are shining like a star. He quickly packed up his weapons: a spear, a bow and a small mountain of worn arrows. He swung up his bow and walked out in bored steps as if he was a forlorn and melancholy elephant alone in the dark nights of the plateau. He pulled a leather cloak and disappeared in the scarlet morning clouds.
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>A few hours later, He arrived at the roofed forest. He saw the powerful power of nature: The green vines stretching down to the great wide bushes; the thick canopy with dark and light green extending to the height. He saw the sapphire sky scanning across the canopy.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>He walked back empty-handed. Back to his burrow. He had a small 
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;He also spotted an imperial guard waiting very impatiently. He wants to yell like a dog, maybe?
</div><div>“King Gregory demands your appearance at the royal palace!”&nbsp;the guard declared. Jayden loved challenges. He has faced lots of impossible challenges. But will there be another more &nbsp;impossible challenge for him to face? So, he threw off his stuff and raced off toward the palace. He didn’t care about the old craggy well, he didn’t care about the birds above. About 40 minutes later, he arrived at the palace.
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>The palace was also made of quartz. The quartz was even more smooth than Jayden’s hut. There were golden patterns covering the palace like the vines.The huge, red gate was the easiest item to spot. He pushed open the red door. He felt the hundred and one golden nails on the door and the cracks; he smelled the elder door; he heard the smooth musical sound when the door opened. He walked in majestically with sarcastic. 
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>It was a complete different scene inside: The torches fire danced in the room of Greg. Jayden found him self standing on the bloody red carpet again. He found cobblestone walls all around him and some of them had mazy moss on it. Then, he spotted King Gregory sitting on his golden throne. He wore a peaceful golden cloak and a golden crown with lots of jewels on it. He really likes gold, does he?
</div><div>“Go to the Maths town now or die immediately!”&nbsp;spat Gregory&nbsp;with a menacing glint in his eye.&nbsp;“Ferociously, Professor Algebra&nbsp;is haunting&nbsp;the city, he is a scary&nbsp;professor with&nbsp;sharp&nbsp;teeth&nbsp;like a vampire. Everyone is petrified! Many a brave warrior like Odysseus, have tried to defeat&nbsp;him, but unfortunately none have succeeded. He was smart,&nbsp;outwitting the warriors.”&nbsp;
</div><div>“Why me?”&nbsp;snapped Jayden.
</div><div>"I say you! Or else…" assaulted Gregory.
</div><div>"Else……." Jayden said.
</div><div>"Die."
</div><div>"What will you reward me when I return?" Jayden asked in greed.
</div><div>"Nothing." Gregory said weakly, "Nothing, except for you earn a slightly longer life."
</div><div>"Why shall I do that?" Gregory asked, like a uncooked dumpling, "What if I don't return?"
</div><div>"I will send my assassins, to kill you." 
</div><div>"What if I don't succeed?"
</div><div>"You die." Gregory said, with a smile of cruelty, "You have three chances. I will have hundreds of spies spying for you and sending messages to you. If yo don't complete the mission in three chances, you die."
</div><div>"I will not complete the mission." Jayden said with fake strength.
</div><div>"I would recommend you to give sir Jayden a reward for winning." Said one of the waiting guards.
</div><div>"Fine. If you complete the mission, I will reward you a chance to challenge me and become the high king." Gregory said unwillingly.
</div><div>Then, there was long silence. For Jayden it seemed like a million years.
</div><div>Finally, Jayden nodded, and walked out melancholy.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Slowly, Jayden stumbled out the palace like a exhausted hiker, or a hurt soldier. The mission he had thought to be exciting has now it will become a disaster-he might not survive, or wouldn't survive! Chances are that he would die and his body would rot
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>He looked in the sky of dusk. The golden sun stared down at him while the crowded clouds chatted competitively about what Jayden would do. He thought, “What shall I do?”. He sighed, “I really shouldn’t gone to King Gregory’s palace at all!”. But then, he saw groups of flamingos flying past the sky like shooting stars. The army of flamingos had crowded groups and lined up groups. Jayden, who is also smart, knew instantly that it was Morse code. It said: --. --- -....- .- -. -.. -....- .-.. --- --- -.- -....- ..-. --- .-. -....- ..-. .-.. --- .-. . -. -.-. . -....- ..-. .-.. .- -- .. -. --. --- -....- ... .... . -....- -.-. .- -. -....- .... . .-.. .--. -....- -.-- --- ..- -....- &nbsp;.- .-.. --- - which means: ‘Go and look for Florence Flamingo! She can help you a lot!’ Jayden was now so excited that he shook and hurt his head! But that didn’t matter for Jayden because he was terrific! He went to his wooden carriage and head off to Florence’s palace.
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>When he reached Florence’s palace, the pink flamingoes flew past above his head like kites. The door opened automatically. Florence Flamingo, who is sitting in a royal silk cloak and wearing a golden fire crown said in a calm and clear voice: "You've finally arrived. My flamingos were listening quite impatiently outside Greg's palace. But his enormous anger’s sound was so loud that even I’ve heard it.” she laughed,”&nbsp;What do you need?”&nbsp;
</div><div>“I need a enchanted fire sword. Enchanted”. 
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>Then the crafting started. The ‘wraaa wraaa’ sound of flipping, the ‘ding ding’ sound of anvils and the loud noise of chatting. Jayden was waiting quite patiently while the flamingos crafted with their useless wings. But anyway, the crowd crafting was finished as Jayden waved goodbye to Florence.
</div><div>“Last thing to tell you, kid: go to Penguin Professor and he will make you the magic portal to go to Math town. Said Florence.
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>So he strode to Penguin without any hesitation. He asked and Penguin simply just said,
</div><div>&nbsp;“I will bring you to it.”.&nbsp;Then he walked away. But Jayden followed up as he found the magic portal. It is pretty much like the Ender portal in Minecraft!
</div><div>“Boo!” screamed penguin with his old sound and Jayden fell in the portal.
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>Darkness. Complete darkness. There were no light at all except for one little dot. The dot was getting bigger. Soon Jayden found that it is a small 3D cube and he is in five dimensional space! He crashed on to the cube as Jayden thought it would hurt so he screamed “Yoooo!”. He didn’t crash but he crashed a few seconds later heavily on to the..........blue grass? Seriously, the grass was blue. It even moved! The Mathians walked toward him. He thought they would be tragic. But according to what Greg said, They would be helpful. So Jayden asked, “Do you know where Professor Algebra lives?”
</div><div>The Mathians all pointed at a mountain toward his left side and Jayden nodded and took off. He didn’t even take any time looking at the environment! He ran across the fields, he swam over the river, climbed up the extremely steep hills and into the lair of Professor algebra. “Har har har! &nbsp;Roarrrr!”. His laughing and roaring rolled repeatably around the cold cave. Jayden shivered and drew out his sword, creating a source of light and heat. He felt a bit more comforted. Professor walked out and cursed a deadly spell, “Go to zero!”he screamed.
</div><div>“Yow!”screamed Jayden as he dodged the blue fireball. He slashed the sword as Professor fired another zero curse, but the sword reflected the shot as the shot went right beside his ears. But by that time, Jayden had already slashed Algebra in half!
</div><div>“Hooray!” yelled Jayden as he sprinted out the lair. The Mathians cheered around him-no one dared to touch him because they were afraid that Jayden might rage. Jayden was known as ‘Eliminator 2000’. They built him a portal as &nbsp;Jayden jumped in........
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>2000 years later......
</div><div>Jayden wakes up as his alarms ring. He went to Harrow in his normal blazers and stuff as the mighty house captain of Churchill......
</div><div>&nbsp;Jayden thought that being the king wasn't so useful, so he didn't challenge King Gregory</div><div>Remember, any time when you have to do something challenging, always do it in another way or do something that your enemy is not good at(If your challenging object is a person like professor Algebra).
