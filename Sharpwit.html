<div>
</div><div>It was 1964 when Sharpwit first appeared; We were having English class when he turned up; everything went black and dark as the alarms went off. We ran. We all ran; we all ran the wrong way: Into the mouth of the lion. Suddenly I heard a cry from the front; the voice was tortured and crackled: “RUN-NNNNNNNNNNNN” People started running backwards like the waves; pushing up the beach and escaping back. I finally understood what was happening, but it was just too late. The running waves pinched me down to the cold tiles of the floor. When the waves finally left, it was only me and my fallen friends on the floor, and one another; a tall, sleek and dark person. I couldn’t see his face clearly until he pulled his hood off; he was handsome added up with fear. I know who he was: Sharpwit. 
</div><div>
</div><div>He drew his swords; not one, two. He slashed it through the one closest to him. The boy; dazed; fell to the floor, dead. But there was no cut in him. I understood; Sharpwit killed his soul. I started to run; Sharpwit already killed most of my friend’s soul. 
</div><div>“He’s coming for me” I thought with fear. I tripped, fell to the floor flat. And was pinched to the floor. For the first time in my life, I started reviewing my life. The sun on the from the view of the beach finally faded; the sadness of a breakup, leaves.
</div><div>“It’s finished, finally” I tried to relax. The blade went down my arm. I screamed with my highest pitch. No one came. Then it was gone. Gone. Gone.
</div><div>
</div><div>I remember II
</div><div>
</div><div>I woke up in the busy hospital. People swarmed around me. I wiggled my toe to see if it was a dream; It was NOT. Then cheer swarmed: I’m alive! Then I remembered the darkness. My arm, my precious arm! I looked right to my hurt arm. I can see it. But I can’t fell it there. I tried to move it. It was like trying to flap your ears. My heart swiveled with coldness. I lost a hand. 
</div><div>I tried to cheer myself up, but I can’t. 
</div><div>“How could I work?” I asked myself. 
</div><div>
</div><div>Then I looked around at the environment around me. The high ceiling and the fogged windows. I stretched my neck to inspect the ground. It was white tiles, smaller than the ones in the accident. Between the tiles was a small aisle of dirty mud. I looked around me: worried nurses pushing carts filled with medicines and, sad people crouching over beds, weeping. I sort of felt sorry for them. Chances are, their souls are dead. I am lucky. Only my right arm is dead; at least I’m alive, the only survivor attacked by Sharpwit.
</div><div>
</div><div>School 
</div><div>
</div><div>School went perfectly normal except some students are chatting about the even that happened. 
</div><div>“They weren’t scared about Sharpwit, are they?” I said to my friend, Joe Taylor.
</div><div>“They are, but they wouldn’t show it, Howard.” Joe said. 
</div><div>I hesitated before saying this, “Don’t tell anyone about this, okay?” I pointed at my arm, which I didn’t feel at all. Joe simply nodded. We walked to our lockers. The students dimmed out as we passed the place where Sharpwit attacked. I saw silvery blood on the cold floor. I paused. Joe kept walking.
</div><div>“JOE” I shouted, “There is BLOOD”
</div><div>“Blood? I don’t see anything!” Joe said innocently.
</div><div>“I promise, there is blood!” I said.
</div><div>“I don’t see anything. You should probably go to the hospital.”
</div><div>
</div><div>I saw green, transparent bodies on the ground. They were my killed friends! The I found an arm. I fallen off arm. I knew who’s arm it is mine. I grabbed it; Half expecting I could even touch it. But I took it up and stuffed it in my bag.
</div><div>
</div><div>“Joe!” I shouted. I ran to our lockers. But he wasn’t there.
</div><div>“He must have gone to the bus.” I thought to myself and went left into the library.
</div><div>
</div><div>Esmeralda Carmentor
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;I walked into the nearly-empty library. I saw the librarian on the far side of the library pack up her handbag. She carried some heavy books and left. Then I looked to my left. There was a young girl, sitting there. She was reading a thick book called《War&amp;Peace》. She sat there, calmly. Her tiny bag was sat just right beside her. Uncontrollably, I walked towards her. She looked up; her eyes were friendly; blue and pure like a galaxy spread wide; shining. I strange feeling surged up me. 
</div><div>“Hi” I said shyly.
</div><div>“Hi” She said equally shyly.
</div><div>“I’m called Howard. Howard Blake.” I said.
</div><div>“I’m called Esmeralda Carmentor.” She said back.
</div><div>“Aren’t you scared?” I asked, pushing the limit a bit more.
</div><div>“About what?” 
</div><div>“About Sharpwit!” I said, amazed.
</div><div>“I am. But there is one thing that you can do. Not care.”
</div><div>“What if he comes again?” I said.
</div><div>“Your arm!” She exclaimed “it wasn’t moving.” 
</div><div>“I’m okay.” I said sarcastically.
</div><div>She grinned. I took a book as thick as her book.
</div><div>“Dream of the red chamber,” She said, “It’s a good book. I like it.”
</div><div>We sat on the same couch together until 6pm. 
</div><div>“I have to go.” I said.
</div><div>“Me too.”
</div><div>We packed our bags and went the different way.
</div><div>
</div><div>The road of dawn
</div><div>
</div><div>I was walking home with my heavy bag. I know what the feeling is. I like her. She’s so calm. The road under me seems to say, “You two belong together.” I don’t think it was real but I walked on. The sun was setting as sad birds flew past. 
</div><div>“She’ll never like me.” I said, “I even lost an arm.”
</div><div>I walked past the stream under the bridge. It was nearly dried out. The autumn leaves fell off the forlorn trees; the small pieces of paint fell of the melancholy building.
</div><div>“I said it was the end. It wasn’t”
</div><div>My funny valentine
</div><div>sweet comic valentine
</div><div>You make me smile with my heart
</div><div>Your lips are laughable
</div><div>Unphotographable
</div><div>Yet you're my favoring work of art
</div><div>Is your figure less than Greek
</div><div>Is your mouth a little weak?
</div><div>When you open it to speak?
</div><div>are you smart?
</div><div>But don't change a hair for me
</div><div>Not if you care for me
</div><div>stay little valentine stay
</div><div>Each day is valentine's day
</div><div>I sang this song without thinking. I played this music when I was young. 
</div><div>“Jazz; Music; books; art.” I said weakly, “The only thing that calms you down." 
</div><div>
</div><div>I reached the small village house. Stepped into my garden and sat down for homework.
</div><div>
</div><div>School II
</div><div>
</div><div>I walked to the first day of our lesson. I was bright and happy because of meeting with Esmeralda. I didn’t know what was going to happen next; it was something terrible. We did everything normal. I sat front to the left. I was staring at Esmeralda. She walked to a seat right behind me. Still carrying the colossal book. Things were just normal as it should be until the world is greyish and dark. We couldn’t see any colours except for black and white. Sharpwit attacked the school again.
